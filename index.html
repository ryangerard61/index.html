<p>Eric S. of Germany   Eric was having a problem (black screen) with his Atari PAL 2600 console.  He contacted Best via E-Mail.  A couple of E-Mails back forth, Best recommended Eric get a new set of Atari 2600 plug in PAL chips.  "I just received the 3 chips I ordered from you in March.  I already put them in my 2600 and what can I say?! It works!!!  Thank you very much, for your help and customer service.  If I need anything else for my Atari I will order from you.  Big thanks again, I hope you are doing fine in those crazy times."</p>
                  
<p>>John D. of CA  John ordered 2 new Best CX40 Joysticks upgraded with the Best designed CX40 Gold lifetime inner PCB board, Best designed new CX40 lifetime Silicon Joystick boot, Best designed / Upgraded CX40 inner Super Handle, and just released Best designed Upgraded / Enhanced CX40 Gold 7 ft (stock CX40 cable is only 4 ft) Joystick cable.  Basically the Best of the Best upgraded CX40 Joystick Bests sells.   "Thank you for the Joysticks!!!!  They rock!  Even my 17 year old had fun!!!"</p>
                           
<p>Scott S. of UT.  Scott took advantage of Bests Atari 5200 CX52 Joystick exchange program.  He sent in two old non working Atari Carbon dot CX52 Joystick cores and received back two Reconditioned / Upgraded Best CX52 Gold Lifetime Joysticks.  "I wanted to let you know that I received my better then new Atari 5200 controllers today and they work great! Now I can really play my 5200 games they way they were meant to be played. Thank you for your great customer service and for the fantastic work you did in making my controllers better then new!" </p>
